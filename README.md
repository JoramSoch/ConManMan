The contrast manager manager for SPM software package in fMRI data analysis.

This little collection of scripts helps in setting up the SPM contrast manager for very complicated experimental designs with a large number of regressors. For example, multiple t-contrasts can be carefully generated as a contrast times regressor matrix and then entered into a contrast manager job. For a demo, see "cmm_demo.m".
